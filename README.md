#Creating a Test in testcafe
TestCafe allows you to write tests using TypeScript or JavaScript (with its modern features like async/await). You get all the advantages of strongly-typed languages like rich coding assistance, painless scalability, check-as-you-type code verification, etc., by using TypeScript to write your TestCafe tests. For more information about writing tests in TypeScript, see TypeScript Support.

To create a test, create a new .js or .ts file. This file must have a special structure - tests must be organized into fixtures.

#The Stucture of testcases
1 Main tests folder having below 3 .js file
1 createAccount.js
2 forgotPasswordScript.js
3 loginScript.js
